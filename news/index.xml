This article is based on the thesis I did for the completion of my studies in the Big Data Management and Analytics (BDMA) Erasmus Mundus MSc.
Abstract
Deep Learning (DL) has consistently surpassed other Machine Learning methods and achieved state-of-the-art performance in multiple cases.</description></item><item><title>Intro to geospatial data analysis with Python - learndatasci.com</title><link>https://iprapas.github.io/news/learndatasci-geospatial-pt1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iprapas.github.io/news/learndatasci-geospatial-pt1/</guid><description>Check my new article - Analyze Geospatial Data in Python: GeoPandas and Shapely in learndatasci.com.
