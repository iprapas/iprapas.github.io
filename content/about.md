In my work, I am a Machine Learning and Big Data engineer and I love programming. Deep down I am a person that likes to explore the world and learn about science and humanity. I am especially interested in astrophysics, neuroscience, biology and life sciences.

This blog is meant to log my findings in my day-to-day use of technologies and methods in my areas of work. Also, I'll be happy to share any knowledge I discover that may be useful to others.

In case you want to reach me, feel free to drop me [an email](/web/mail.html).
