Professionally speaking, I am a Software Engineer with an interest in Machine Learning and Big Data. I love coding and designing algorithms. As a person, I like to explore the world and learn about science and humanity. I am especially interested in astrophysics, neuroscience, biology and life sciences. I like spending time with friends, watching movies, playing board games and doing sports. Deep down, I am just like you; an insignificant human being. Sorry, that was just a joke; I mean we are special, the universe, stardust etc.

Jokes aside, this blog is meant to log any findings in my day-to-day use of technologies and methods in my areas of work. Also, I'll be happy to share any knowledge I discover that may be useful to others, although I am probably the only person to read anything from here.

In case you want to reach me, feel free to drop me [an email](mailto:iprapas+blog@protonmail.com).
