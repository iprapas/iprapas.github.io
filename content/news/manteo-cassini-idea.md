I am really excited to announce [Manteo](https://manteo.space), a startup idea we had with great friends. 

**Manteo name inspiration**: The name Manteo comes from the Greek word μαντείο, which is the sacred precinct where oracles like Pythia were consulted about important decisions in the ancient classical world. The name combines the aspect of an oracle, with the suffix EO, i.e. an oracle for Earth Observation.

**Our vision** - to create an oracle that brings easy access to advanced Earth Observation capabilities, democratizing planetary awareness 🌍! 


Last week, we learned [Manteo](https://manteo.space) won the [euspa cassini idea award](https://www.euspa.europa.eu/cassini-challenges-winners-2023) 🥇


The award is only the beginning! The more we worked on the idea, the more we believed in it and in our team to make it a reality. We have already built a functioning prototype and we are going to be **rolling out early access real soon**.
