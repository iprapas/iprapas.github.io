Title: Wildfire danger forecasting at different spatio-temporal scales
Abstract: Climate change exacerbates the occurence of extreme droughts and heatwaves, increasing the frequency and intensity of large wildfires across the globe.</description></item><item><title>Deep Learning for Daily Wildfire Danger Forecasting (NeurIPS 2021)</title><link>https://iprapas.github.io/news/hadrai-neurips-poster/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iprapas.github.io/news/hadrai-neurips-poster/</guid><description>Happy to present our publication in the NeurIPS 2021 at the workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response (hadr.ai).
