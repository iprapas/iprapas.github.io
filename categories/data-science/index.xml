From online courses, with most notable one the Coursera course on Machine Learning with Andrew NG. Some others included Scalable Machine Learning with Spark, and Computational Thinking and Data Science with Python. From my thesis, which had a limited focus on deep learning. I lacked, however, any practical experience and although I wanted to join kaggle competitions in the past, I did not really know how to start.</description></item></channel></rss>
