      <description>Disclaimer: This blog post will present my solution to an exercise of the Scalable Data Science offered by TU Berlin in winter semester 2019-2020.
Introduction In this exercise, we had to learn a model to classify spam, nospam SMS messages. We were given the SMS Spam Collection Data Set, split in 4 files:
  training_spam.txt
  training_nospam.txt
  testing_spam.txt
  testing_spam.txt
  The goal is to train a model on the contents of the training* files and use it to predict the testing*.</description>
