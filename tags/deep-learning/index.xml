Title: Wildfire danger forecasting at different spatio-temporal scales
Abstract: Climate change exacerbates the occurence of extreme droughts and heatwaves, increasing the frequency and intensity of large wildfires across the globe.</description></item><item><title>Webinar: Fighting wildfires with AI-powered insights</title><link>https://iprapas.github.io/news/itu-talk-2023/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iprapas.github.io/news/itu-talk-2023/</guid><description>Happy to present in the ITU Webinar on &amp;ldquo;Fighting wildfires with AI-powered insights&amp;rdquo; on Aprin 19th.
